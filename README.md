# OmniView
OmniView is an experimental GUI for the measurement-devices of the research-collaboration AW4null.
It's purpose is the display and the handling of data, generated by [Auto-Intern OmniScopes](https://www.auto-intern.de/shop/). 
 

## Planned functionallity
The plan of AW4null is to enhance car-diagnostics with AI-powered diagnostic-services.
Diagnostic-services will be reachable through differen REST-APIs and will be specialized on a lot of different purposes.
Physical-measurements of automotive-sensors will be taken, displayed in OmniView and send to an API at the users will.
OmniView shall receive data from multiple generators, such as OmniScopes and OmniB-, OmniE-Clamp and OmniPressure. 
The data will come in as a binary stream of 24-bit integers.
Since the incoming data represents measurement-samples in the time-domain, the individual channels will be synchronized.
This is done in a currently non-public-repo of Auto-Intern, but will be separated into a `.dll` or `.so` respectively.
The acquired data can be viewed on the OmniView GUI and may then be saved to the hard-drive in `.csv` or binary format. 
Anyhow, another possibility is to send the measurement to a REST-API provided by the [THGA](https://www.thga.de). 

### First Phase Development
In it's first phase, only one API will be used, documented by [this Repository](https://gitlab.thga.de/aw4null/aw4null_api-description_ref/-/blob/main/openapi.json?ref_type=heads). 
The API will be able to receive training-data for AI-training purposes.

# Building OmniView
Building is currently only possible with specially provided access-rights, but will be made available to the wider public as soon as the migration to a closed-source shared-library for device handling has been done as described in [Issue #36](https://github.com/skunkforce/omniview/issues/36).
In order to ask for access-rights, contact [@bjoekeldude](https://github.com/bjoekeldude).


Anyhow, building __IS__ available in CI. A push into any branch will generate a new binary, that can be downloaded via the [Action-Tab](https://github.com/skunkforce/omniview/actions).


Building requires `cmake --version > 3.20` as well as a `c++20`-Compiler.
## Linux

### Prerequisites
In order to start the compilation, following packages need to be ensured:
* build-essential 
* autoconf 
* gtk-doc-tools 
* libtool 
* intltool 
* curl 
* zip 
* unzip 
* tar 
* libudev-dev
* libxinerama-dev 
* libxcursor-dev 
* xorg-dev 
* libglu1-mesa-dev 
* pkg-config

### Compile
Move into OmniView-directory, update and initialize all submodules:
```shell
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
create build-directory and run cmake from there:
```shell
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
```
Start the compilation by using the CMake-command:
```shell
cmake --build .
```

In order to run OmniView it needs admin-rights right now:
```shell
sudo ./OmniView
```

## Windows
Move into OmniView-directory, update and initialize all submodules:
```shell
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

create build-directory and run cmake from there with defined `VCPKG_TARGET_TRIPLET`:
```shell
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DVCPKG_TARGET_TRIPLET="x64-windows-static"
```

Start compilation using CMake:
```shell
cmake --build .
```
